# COEN/ELEC-390 Team Project: 
An android platform application


1. Displays weather forecast for the day & week of any location
2. Depending on the forecast, you receive a set of clothing suggestion(so that you can remain comfy even if there's a major cataclysmic event happening outside)
3. You can add you own clothes to the app and it will suggest what you should wear
4. You can add tracker tags and get notifications if you lose it(i.e: track your own wallet so that you won't need to call the bank)


## Guide-How to install and run it

**Note**: As of now, we haven't really realesed this, so it's free for any one to grab.
1. Install Android Studio
2. Download or clone this repo
3. Within Android Studio, you can open the project file
4. You can run an emulator
5. Otherwise, you will need to have developper mode enabled on an android phone and allow Android Studio to install it
