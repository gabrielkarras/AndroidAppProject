# COEN/ELEC-390 Team Project: 
An android platform application


1. Displays weather forecast for the day & week of any location
2. Depending on the forecast, you receive a set of clothing suggestion(so that you can remain comfy even if there's a major cataclysmic event happening outside)
3. You can add you own clothes to the app and it will suggest what you should wear
4. You can add tracker tags and get notifications if you lose it(i.e: track your own wallet so that you won't need to call the bank)
